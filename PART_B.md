# Assement Task 3 Part B Portfolio
### By Riley Dowse


### Identifying and defining
Need- A game that is suitable for nearly all ages but is cartered towards pre-teens looking for a unique but well crafted experience that teaches them an important lesson.

## Ideas
**Astrixed Idea is the Idea I ended up Selecting** 
- ### Top Down Starfighter game*

Description:
Top down space fighter game that is a lot about carrying cargo. It will teach you about risk and reward, with a custom economy 


|Postive|Minus|Intreasting|
|-------|-----|-----------|
| I have learnt a lot about 2d devlopent with Part A of this Assement and the games| I will have to do a lot of pixel art and do a lot of UI design. This could also come out lack luster due to the depth required|  |


### A 3d game which uses change of prespectives to solve puzzles.
Description:
This game is all  about changing perspectives to solve a puzzle and demonstrating that others have powerful strengths. It means that only one part of the puzzle will make sense to one but no sense to others. You need to change perspectives to see the whole picture (or puzzle).

|Postive|Minus|Intreasting|
|-------|-----|-----------|
|Would provide a great lesson in 3d game devlopment. It would also be a unique and fun challenge to code and develop.|Difficult to program 3d games. It's likely I won't be able to finish more than 1 or 2 levels due to the complexity of the game. |There isn't really a game quite like it. It's a really cool idea but probalby needs a lot more than 6 weeks to execute it well.|


- ### Janky FPS Game with Unique movement.

|Postive|Minus|Intreasting|
|-------|-----|-----------|
|Lots of Online resoures. Will most likely be easy to code despite being 3d.| There's a lot of unique Fps games out there and it also doesn't teach a lesson or story.| The movement system would be super fun. 






Skill Development: In order to develop the skills that will be necessary to complete this task to the best of my abillity I will utillise a range of online resources which includes but is not limited to YT tutorials, Unity/Stack Overflow Forrums and Unity Documentation.

## Consideration of Social and ethical issues

### Acessibility 
My game needs to be acessible to a wide variety of audiences.


### Privacy and data protection
My game doesn't collect personal data. The program only collects boring data about the game that can't be used to discrimstrate.

### Fairness and Reputation
My project will avoid sterotypes and allow a wide range 

### Mental and emotional wellbeing 
My game does involve simulated violence and flashing light.
It is a



### Cultral senstivities
From my limited cultral knowledge, I belive that there is nothing that is insensetive to other culture
or religion however I will make sure the continue this in devlopment.




## Researching and planning
Its a coincedence that all 3 games start with an S ok.
|Existing Idea|Postive|Minus|Intreasting|
|-------------|-------|-----|-----------|
|Startrucker![alt text](Images\Startrucker.jpg)|A unique space experience. Great events with a touch of chaos in order to repair|Lacks replaybility and instantly feels stale after finishing the main story.|My game is simlar in idea to this game but has a unique excution 
|Stardew Valley![alt text](Images\Stardew.jpg)|Fun, Light relaxing pixel art game. Enticing gameplay + incredible pixel art and music/sound effect design|Gets  boring, diffcult to know what to do. Too much to do and consfusign what to choose first.| It's an amazing example that Solo development is possible and also that popular and fun games don't have to be 3d and can return to the retro and unique 2d style|
|Sea of Thieves ![alt text](Images\Sea-of-thieves.jpg)|An amazingly chaotic and fun multiplayer experience. Great game to do whatever you want|The PVE content is pretty shallow (laugh at my joke). The game also is nowhere near as fun solo.|
