# Assessment Task 3 Part B Portfolio
### By Riley Dowse




# Identifying and defining
Need- A game that is suitable for nearly all ages but is catered towards pre-teens looking for a unique but well crafted experience that teaches
them an important lesson that is relatable to life through fun and innovative gameplay.


## Ideas
**Asterixed Idea is the Idea I ended up Selecting**
- ### Top Down Starfighter game*


Description:
Top down space fighter game that is about a lot about carrying cargo. It will teach you about risk and reward, with a custom economy




|Positive|Minus|Interesting|
|-------|-----|-----------|
| I have learnt a lot about 2d development with Part A of this Assessment and the games| I will have to do a lot of pixel art and do a lot of UI design. This could also come out lackluster due to the depth required| Fit's my ideas really well and is achievable in the time frame. An unique and fun idea that can be executed within the timeframe |




### A 3d game which uses change of perspectives to solve puzzles.
Description:
This game is all  about changing perspectives to solve a puzzle and demonstrating that others have powerful strengths. It means that only one part of the puzzle will make sense to one but no sense to others. You need to change perspectives to see the whole picture (or puzzle).


|Positive|Minus|Interesting|
|-------|-----|-----------|
|Would provide a great lesson in 3d game development. It would also be a unique and fun challenge to code and develop.|Difficult to program 3d games. It's likely I won't be able to finish more than 1 or 2 levels due to the complexity of the game. |There isn't really a game quite like it. It's a really cool idea but probably needs a lot more than 6 weeks to execute it well.|




- ### Janky FPS Game with Unique movement.


|Positive|Minus|Interesting|
|-------|-----|-----------|
|Lots of Online resources. Will most likely be easy to code despite being 3d.| There's a lot of unique Fps games out there and it also doesn't teach a lesson or story.| The movement system would be super fun.










### What need does my game address?
It addresses the need for a unique 2D game that teaches an important lesson about economic strategy/resource management while including fast paced combat to teach risk and reward. It appeals to the need for an action oriented teaching experience which teaches economic choices with virtual consequences.


### Problem Statement
There's a gap for a 2D space game that combines fast paced combat with dynamic trading and reputation. While space combat and trading are often explored separately, there is a need for a game that integrates both elements with exciting combat and strategic economic decisions. This combination would appeal to players seeking action and strategic gameplay within one game.
### Skill Development:
In order to develop the skills that will be necessary to complete this task to the best of my ability I will utilize a range of online resources which includes but is not limited to YT tutorials, Unity/Stack Overflow Forums and Unity Documentation.
## Requirements outline
### Inputs
User inputs will include Arrow Key and WASD movement, Left Click and Spacebar for primary shoot/ attack.
For menus the arrow keys/ mouse movement is used to navigate them and Enter/Right click will select on the menus
In order to be accessible to laptops, the game needs to be playable without left clicks as they are inconsistent and difficult to use. However the game can still utilize left clicks for those that do have a mouse.
- WASD/ Arrow Keys Movement
- LEft Click/Spacebar Attack
- Right click/Q for missiles
- F for Special Move
- E for inventory
- R for repairs
- ESC for pause menu
- H for Auto pilot
### Processing
The game processing will check for collisions/updates and respond accordingly. It will calculate the player's position and animation stage and adapt accordingly.When Money is earned or lives lost the respective counters will be processed and updated.


### Outputs
The game needs to output a lot of screens in order to be a unique and fun game. My game will include a wide variety of menus, cutscenes and Interfaces.
The game will display any of the following screens.


- Main menu
- Pause menu
- Save screen
- Repair menu
- Travelling interface
- Shop interface
- Talking
- Quest interface
- Trading interface
- Not Enough Funds Screen
- Inventory interface
- Game over
- Tutorial
- Arriving on a planet cutscene
- Cargo stop cutscene


### Transmision
There will not be multiplayer support and the game doesn't need to transmit any data to clouds or servers. Because of the lack of need for servers this game will be completely accessible offline.
### Storage
The program will store save data locally. The program will need to be able to save where the player is, the player's progress and their user settings. The program will save after a purchase has been made, a quest completed or accepted and lastly when you use the save button in the menu.


It will first save what planet you are on/ where in space you are, your inventory, your ship and finally your user settings. As this data won't affect the users of the game if hacked/released as its non it doesn't include any identifiable information so no need to worry about data privacy concerns.




## Functional Requirements


### User Interaction
The user will be able to interact with the game through keyboard and Mouse. In the menu specifically they will be able to navigate to a wide variety of options to adjust and personalize their gameplay. The player will able to interact during gameplay to move their character around to avoid obstacles and use weapons against enemies or environmental obstacles. Another example would be interaction when flying your ship which will allow players to move their ship around, repair it from damage and check its inventory


### Core Gameplay


### Movement
The Movement should feel casual but easy to use and operate while still remaining challenging enough to cause action with the game.


### Combat
Combat should feel intense, strategic, chaotic and rewarding. Combat should offer players unique tactical opportunities. The combat mechanics need to complement the players exploring and trading with a focus on multitasking and ship management.


### Trading and Economy
The game's trading and economy system is going to be engaging and dynamic forcing players to consider their choices and make trading strategic and rewarding with offering complexity with supply and demand, risk vs reward and adaptive markets which have scams and lowballers. You will be able to buy and sell different items and travel and make use of your trades.


### Scoring and Feedback
My game uses gold and reputation as a scoring and feedback system to provide players with a sense of progression, challenge and award. Gold unlocks better items and potentially cosmetics. For completing more difficult/length missions/challenges/fights you will be given a higher quality of economic goods that can be sold to receive gold. Furthermore this feedback encourages successful trades to earn profit. On the other hand faction reputation
Visual feedback will be given by showcasing gold and reputation gains and losses.




### Saving and Loading Data

You will be able to load the data by selecting the game file. The save files will be saved with the time, date+name of the save  and replace the previous save file. You will only be able to save one but you can start a new game that won't override the first.

## Non Functional Requirements


### Performance Requirements
The game should be able to load all menus/screens in under 3 seconds and respond to user inputs instantly, without noticeable lag. The game should run smoothly on a wide variety of Window 11 devices without screen tearing,feeling clunky or having graphical problems for the user.




### Usability requirements
The simulation will include a clear, beginner-friendly tutorial to explain the core mechanics to first-time users. It will also pit them against beginner designed bots to teach them with gameplay.




### Compatibility requirements
Must be compatible with Windows 11 laptops and PCs. The controls will only use keyboard and mouse pad/mouse. The game must be accessible on a weird variety of hardware.


### Reliability and Availability


The system should be bug free and reliable, with error handling to prevent data loss. The program needs to be polished before completion while avoiding as many bugs as possible. When the game goes through the testing phase, all bugs will be noted and patched. My game will display a clear error and write to an error log if the game crashes, it will also attempt to save the users data to the best of its ability to avoid data loss.


## Consideration of Social and ethical issues


### Define the following terms:
Equity:


The quality of being fair and unbiased. It involves ensuring that people have the same access to all elements of their game considering their needs and circumstances.




Accessibility:


Being easy to use and access by a wide variety of people. It involves removing/adapting gameplay that prevents individuals from playing my game. In my example it includes making it accessible for those with visual and auditory impairments.




### Accessibility
My game needs to be accessible to a wide variety of audiences. My project will include features like subtitles and visual adjustments to accommodate users with disabilities.


### Privacy and data protection
My game doesn't collect personal data. The program only collects data about the game that can't be used to discriminate against the game's users. However I will ensure that I properly store the data by using encryption anyway.


### Fairness and Reputation
My project will avoid stereotypes and bias. I will use characters that are diverse and I will avoid harmful stereotypes based on gender, race or culture.


### Mental and emotional wellbeing
My game does involve simulated violence and flashing lights. It will disclose this in the install of the game and the loading screen. My game will promote taking a break when the playtime reaches an unhealthy amount.




### Cultural sensitivities
From my limited cultural knowledge, I believe that there is nothing that is insensitive to other culture
or religion however I will make sure to continue this in development. I will be mindful of symbols or themes that might be inappropriate or misunderstood by users from different cultural backgrounds. If there is something that is inappropriate I will adapt my game and take upon feedback.






# Researching and planning
### PMI of existing ideas


|Existing Idea|Positive|Minus|Interesting|
|-------------|-------|-----|-----------|
|Startrucker![alt text](Images\Startrucker.jpg)|A unique space experience. Great events with a touch of chaos in order to repair|Lacks replayability and instantly feels stale after finishing the main story.|My game is similar in idea to this game but has a unique execution
|Stardew Valley![alt text](Images\Stardew.jpg)|Fun, Light relaxing pixel art game. Enticing gameplay + incredible pixel art and music/sound effect design|Gets  boring, difficult to know what to do. Too much to do and confusing what to choose first.| It's an amazing example that Solo development is possible and also that popular and fun games don't have to be 3d and can return to the retro and unique 2d style|
|Sea of Thieves ![alt text](Images\Sea-of-thieves.jpg)|An amazingly chaotic and fun multiplayer experience. Great example of an open world game that applies risk and reward|The PVE content is pretty shallow. The game also is nowhere near as fun solo.| I can use the economic ideals of risk and reward and apply it to my game. I'm able to improve on its downfalls of LOVE by considering the depth and repetition of my quests.

## Story Boards
Overall flow
##### Note: My game is an open world game where quests provide a clear path but you can technically go wherever and do whatever to earn money.(Think Sea of Thieves) Therefore it's very tricky to represent it in a set flow chart.
