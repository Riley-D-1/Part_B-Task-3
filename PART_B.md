# Assement Task 3 Part B Portfolio
### By Riley Dowse


### Identifying and defining
Need- A game that is suitable for nearly all ages but is cartered towards pre-teens looking for a unique but well crafted experience that teaches them an important lesson.

## IDEAS
Astrixed Idea is the Idea I ended up Selecting
- ### Top Down Starfighter game*

Description:
Top down space fighter game that is a lot about carrying cargo. It will teach you about risk and reward, with a custom economy 


|Postive|Minus|Intreasting|
|-------|-----|-----------|
| I have learnt a lot about 2d devlopent with Part A of this Assement and the games| I will have to do a lot of pixel art and do a lot of UI design. This could also come out lack luster due to the depth required|  |


### A 3d game which uses change of prespectives to solve puzzles.
Description:
This game is all  about changing perspectives to solve a puzzle and demonstrating that others have powerful strengths. It means that only one part of the puzzle will make sense to one but no sense to others. You need to change perspectives to see the whole picture (or puzzle).

|Postive|Minus|Intreasting|
|-------|-----|-----------|
|Would provide a great lesson in 3d game devlopment. It would also be a unique and fun challenge to code and develop.|Difficult to program 3d games. It's likely I won't be able to finish more than 1 or 2 levels due to the complexity of the game. |There isn't really a game quite like it. It's a really cool idea but probalby needs a lot more than 6 weeks to execute it well.|


- ### Janky FPS Game with Unique movement.

|Postive|Minus|Intreasting|
|-------|-----|-----------|
|Lots of Online resoures. Will most likely be easy to code despite being 3d.| There's a lot of unique Fps games out there and it also doesn't teach a lesson or story.| The movement system would be super fun. 






Skill Development: In order to develop the skills that will be necessary to complete this task to the best of my abillity i will utillise a range of online resources which includes but is not limited to YT tutorials, Unity/Stack Overflow Forrums and Unity Documentation.
